# IoT-Based-Automated-Entry-System-with-the-Integration-of-Covid-19-Symptom-Detection
Raspberry Pi based entry system which will check for symptoms of COVID-19 to measure the risk factor.

When we started working on this project, we were in the early stage of the global pandemic that has been devastating the whole world for almost 2 and a half years now. We
researched to find that a lot of people were totally unaware of their symptoms and were active carriers of the virus which can endanger the life of their colleagues.

So, at that time we decided to work on a solution which will help people be cautious and aware of their health on a daily basis when they are going for work or to study and also can be used as an entry system. Hence, we came up with this idea of making an *IoT Based Automated Entry System with the Integration of Covid-19 Symptom Detection*.

Our aim was to mitigate the spread of the virus in workplaces and make people feel safer. So the objectives were:
- To use RFID based entry and login mechanics.
- Automated mask detection system.
- To use a contact-less infrared thermometer and a pulse oximeter to check temperature and oxygen saturation level.
- Finally the storing of the data on a database server for monitoring.

To fulfil these objectives we had to work on the functional and nonfunctional requirements to obtain the proper specification of the system tackling some constraints that we faced such as finding a workable dataset and an efficient microcontroller.

The workflow of the system is to get data from the user through multiple sensors in a sequential way and to give a verdict on the risk factor after analysing the data.

To build this project from the ground up we used multiple tools like Raspberry Pi, AutoCAD, Visual Studio Code, Google firebase and machine learning model.

Now, we know that every problem has multiple solutions regardless of efficiency and effectiveness. That is why we had to conjure multiple design approaches to find the optimal
system level design. The optimization factor that we used to get to that result were,
- Efficiency
- Hardware and Output accuracy
- Cost effectiveness
- Usability
- Maintainability and Manufacturability

In our case we went with the *Dynamic Decision Algorithm System With Effective Stand-alone Microcontroller*.

To determine that the device works properly we've also done performance evaluation using test cases. Due to Covid-19 situation the number of test cases was less than we planned
but the result was satisfactory as you can see here.

ðŸ’¡ For instance, the facemask detection accuracy were 99%.
